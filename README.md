# Stanford Intro to AI course work solutions

Solutions for the Stanford "Introduction to AI" course (see Links)
while [we](https://github.com/LondonHackspaceAI/) started going
through it. Some of us then got side tracked into trying it out in
various programming languages.

There's two different algorithms implemented in the examples:

* looking at the number of segments only: julia?, golang?, elang?,

* looking at distance in kilometers: scheme, haskell, cpp?

The solution in scheme/ was at some point the most complete, with the
newest algorithm, optimizations, and rather extensive tests (the one
in haskell/ is equivalent).

None of these have seen any testing with large graphs. Consider that a
TODO.
