Those are the outputs from running with debugging statements enabled:

 a.1  without seen check, before fixing the seen check
 b.1  with seen check, before fixing it

 a    without seen check, now
 b    with seen check, now

Why do we now check more than in the *.1 versions??

Whatever, diffing a and b shows how effective the seen check is.
